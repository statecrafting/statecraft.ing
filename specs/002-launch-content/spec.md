  The words on the site at launch. One index page that states what
  Stagecraft is in the builder's own register (creator-led,
  OSS-credible, no startup theater), a product-family section mapping
  the four repos and their licenses, and an honest status section tied
  to the public milestone ladder. The positioning facts are inlined
  here so the implementing session needs no external archive.

# 002: Launch content

## 0. Implementation amendment (2026-07-14)

Two design points, settled before coding, so the spec matches the code
it owns:

- **Content architecture is React Router v7, not Astro.** The original
  `establishes: src/content/` was residue from the dropped Astro choice
  (spec 001 was itself amended 2026-07-14 to RR7). The launch content
  lives in the RR7 app tree: the index page (`app/routes/_index.tsx`),
  a docs index (`app/routes/docs.tsx`), a docs stub route
  (`app/routes/docs.$slug.tsx`), and two typed content modules
  (`app/lib/docs.ts`, `app/lib/milestones.ts`). No markdown/MDX
  toolchain is introduced: that would be a runtime-of-the-build
  dependency the site does not need, and §1's voice constraints are
  better served by typed content than by a content collection.
- **The status ladder is derived from the baked registry, never
  hardcoded.** §2's "Status" reads its per-milestone position by rolling
  up the `implementation` field of the constituent specs in the
  build-time-baked payload (`public/data/registry.json`), so it re-derives
  on every deploy and cannot drift from source. The authoring-time hint
  ("M1 done: born-green stamp proven") is explicitly superseded by that
  rule: at implementation time the registry shows `enrahitu/009-template-contract`
  is `in-progress` and `enrahitu/012-born-with-provenance` is `pending`,
  so the born-with stamp is not yet proven. The ladder reflects the
  registry truth (§6), not the hint.

## 1. Voice constraints

Written for engineers who evaluate tools by reading source. No
unverifiable claims, no customer logos that do not exist, no "join
thousands". Present tense for what works today, future tense clearly
marked for the ladder. First person singular is acceptable where it
reads naturally (a single creator builds this in the open).

## 2. Content inventory (index page)

- **Hero**: Stagecraft is a governed delivery control plane: intent
  becomes a governed spec, a factory stamps a complete application
  from an open template, a fleet operates the result, and the
  customer's code lives in the customer's GitHub org the whole time.
  One sentence under it: the substrate is EnRaHiTu: Encore.ts +
  rauthy + hiqlite + Turso in a single container with zero managed
  dependencies.
- **The loop** (four short blocks): Specify (spec-spine: markdown
  truth, compiled registries, drift gates in CI), Stamp (template
  contract, born-with certificate binding an explicit agentic
  posture), Operate (one container + one volume per app; update and
  backup as governed verbs), Verify (tamper-evident attestation
  ledger; independent verifier exists).
- **Product family table**: stagecraft (control plane, AGPL-3.0),
  enrahitu (template chassis, Apache-2.0), stagecraft-cli (CLI + MCP
  server, Apache-2.0), spec-spine (governance toolchain, its own
  repo). Each row: one-line role + repo link + license, and the note
  that stamped apps belong to their owners.
- **For agents**: a short section stating the MCP face: coding agents
  operate under the same governance as humans (same verbs, same
  guards, explicit posture, no side doors).
- **Live registry**: a pointer section to the `/registry` viewer
  (spec 001): the product family's spec corpora rendered from
  build-time-baked shards, each page stating the source commit it was
  baked from. This is the "evaluate us by reading source" claim made
  navigable.
- **Status** (kept truthful at every deploy): the milestone ladder
  M1-M5 with current position, linking each milestone to the public
  spec that governs it. At authoring time: M1 done (template contract
  v0, born-green stamp proven), M2-M5 in progress/planned; the
  implementing session must check the repos' registries for the
  then-current truth rather than copying this sentence.
- **Footer**: GitHub org, license notes, no tracking statement.

## 3. Docs seed

Turn the single placeholder docs page (`app/routes/docs.tsx`) into an
index over three real stubs, each rendered by `app/routes/docs.$slug.tsx`
from `app/lib/docs.ts`, sourced from the repos' own READMEs and specs (do
not fork prose; link and summarize): "What is EnRaHiTu", "The template
contract", "Self-hosting the control plane (AGPL)". Where a stub describes
work that is spec-approved but not yet built (the control plane), it says
so in future tense and points at the governing specs, per §1.

## 4. Acceptance

- Every claim on the page is checkable against a public repo at build
  time; the status section names real spec ids.
- Builds clean; internal links resolve; docs stubs render.
- A skim test: a stranger can answer "what is this, what can I run
  today, what license am I touching" from the index alone.

## 5. Out of scope

- Pricing, waitlists, email capture.
- Long-form architecture essays (belong in the repos' specs/docs).

## 6. Status (2026-07-14): complete

Implemented and verified. The launch content replaces the spec-001
placeholders; no new build toolchain was added.

- **Index** (`app/routes/_index.tsx`): hero (the loop stated as thesis +
  the EnRaHiTu substrate line), the four-block loop (Specify / Stamp /
  Operate / Verify, each linking to the spec that governs it), the
  product-family list (from `app/lib/product-family.ts`, licenses shown,
  with the note that stamped apps belong to their owners), a "for agents"
  block pointing at the MCP server spec, a live-registry pointer, and the
  status ladder.
- **Status ladder** (`app/lib/milestones.ts`): M1-M5 mapped to real
  sibling-repo spec ids; the loader rolls each rung up from the baked
  payload at build time. Verified truth at implementation time: **M1
  Substrate 8/8 → shipped** (`enrahitu/001`-`008` complete); **M2 Stamp
  0/2 → in progress** (`enrahitu/009` in-progress, `enrahitu/012`
  pending); **M3 Factory**, **M4 Fleet**, **M5 Verify** → planned
  (`stagecraft/*`, `stagecraft-cli/*` approved, pending). This supersedes
  the §0 authoring hint: the born-with stamp is not yet proven, so the
  ladder does not claim it.
- **Docs** (`app/routes/docs.tsx` index + `app/routes/docs.$slug.tsx` +
  `app/lib/docs.ts`): three stubs (What is EnRaHiTu, The template
  contract, Self-hosting the control plane (AGPL)), each summarizing and
  linking its source, with an honest maturity marker; the control-plane
  stub is marked planned per §1.

Acceptance: every claim links to a public repo or a baked spec id (the
ladder is a pure function of the baked shards); `npm run typecheck` and
`npm run build` are clean (all routes prerendered, including the three new
docs pages); every internal link resolves (all linked registry/docs paths
prerender to 200); the built output makes zero off-origin resource
requests; the skim test holds (what it is, what runs today, and the
licenses are all answerable from the index). Spine gates green (`compile`,
`index`, `lint --fail-on-warn`, `index check`).
