description: Initialize a session by executing the cross-agent New Sessions protocol declared in AGENTS.md.

# /init: session bootstrap

Thin dispatcher. The canonical protocol lives in **`AGENTS.md` § New Sessions**
under the AAIF/Linux Foundation cross-agent standard (the same file is read by
Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, Copilot, and any future agent).

## What to do

1. Read `AGENTS.md`: the section from `## New Sessions` inclusive to the next
   `## ` heading exclusive. That section is the step list.
2. Execute the protocol described there, using parallel tool calls where steps
   are independent.
3. Emit a structured summary as a `## initialized: statecraft.ing` block:
   rules loaded, registry freshness, lifecycle counts (from
   `spec-spine registry status-report --json --nonzero-only`), and the next
   pending spec per `AGENTS.md` § Working the backlog.

This dispatcher deliberately does not duplicate the step list: `AGENTS.md` is
the single source of truth. Evolve the protocol by editing `AGENTS.md`, never
this file, so every agent stays in sync.

The protocol performs its governed reads through the installed `spec-spine`
binary on your `PATH`. If `spec-spine` is not found, run `/setup` first.
